# FOPO-PHP-Deobfuscator
A simple script to deobfuscate PHP file obfuscated with FOPO Obfuscator - http://fopo.com.ar/

There are PHP as well as Python version of the script.

# Python
*python deobfuscator.py obfuscated.php [output=deobfuscated.php]*

# PHP
*php deobfuscator.php obfuscated.php*

In this case the deobfuscated PHP code will be echo-ed because the PHP version of this script is designed to be executed online.

You can deobfuscate indeed your own obfuscated PHP file online here:

Paste the obfuscated PHP file content inside _obfuscated.php_ file, then click _Run_ and you will see the deobfuscated PHP code (I hope :P).
